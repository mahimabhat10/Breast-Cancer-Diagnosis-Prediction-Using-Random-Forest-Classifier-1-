This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on breast cancer cell features. The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and modeled using Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib. The notebook includes data cleaning, feature scaling, model training, evaluation (confusion matrix & classification report), and feature importance visualization
